## Single-file mp3 cutter and concatinator

Standalone file, no installation. Currently supports cutting up mp3 files and adding them together, multiple files may be used.

## Youtube downloader

Also supports Youtube Urls, but has to download them so there's a longer load time

## Future plans

1. Adding customizable segway from cut to cut
2. Volume adjustment
3. Auto-generating subtitles
